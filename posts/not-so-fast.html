                    As the NBA keeps moving towards a world that allows smaller players to flourish with better spacing and ball movement, it seems like the end is near for the prototypical bigs. With analytical progression come numerous ideas as to exactly how to play basketball. While the three point line is the epitome of efficiency, the mid range, which was once a lethal shooting spot for the games brightest, has become a mockery of the inefficient player. We have the Derozans of the world that the stats guys cringe to watch since the “perfect” shot is just a few steps away. This whole 3-point craze has even cast a negative cloud over the consensus #1 draft pick, Ben Simmons who can dish, board and defend 4 out of the 5 positions. For debating sake, if the 2003 draft was done now, people would actually question taking LeBron #1 over the likes of Carmelo! I am not saying Ben Simmons will be the next LeBron, but just needed to show how valuable the 3-point attribute has become.

                    But is this the right thing to do? Can sports be all about stats? If that were the case, there won’t be any upsets or even a challenging league. There is more to winning than just the numbers. And that is what the Oklahoma City Thunder are showing us during these playoffs. They are using energy, determination and size to muscle out victories against a team that analytics will say is perfect through an efficiency stand point. Analytics don’t understand the drive that Durant has every time he brings the ball past half. The numbers don’t show the booing and questions that he gets for not having a championship yet. The stats don’t show the negativity that Westbrook gets or the second fiddle callings that he endures at opposing arenas. The Thunder bigs are showing the NBA that the prototypical bigs will never be extinct, as there is always a hole in the “perfect” team. That’s what makes sports so enjoyable. You think you broke basketball, but then another guy comes over and squishes that theory with one big statement performance. Yes, Curry is injured and isn’t 100%. But it still shows that without his big game shots, players that rely heavily on their 3 point attributes fade much faster than others. Therefore, dear NBA, not so fast with this whole small ball shenanigans.
